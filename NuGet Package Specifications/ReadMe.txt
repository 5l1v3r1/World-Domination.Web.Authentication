   You've nuget installed this package so I don't to explain why this shiz does.

** 3 Steps to World Domination!
******

1. Define which Authentication Providers you wish to offer.

2. Create some View which has the image and/or link to the 3rd party provider you
   wish to offer your users to authenticate against. Eg a google image, etc.
   PRO TIP: This pacakge installed some stock images under /images/Authentication

3. Wire up RedirectToAuthencation in some Method / Module / whatever framework
   you're using.

4. Handle the callback from the 3rd party by wiring up CheckCallback in another Method /
   Module / whatever again.

Done. That's it.

You'll have some generic user information which you can do the frak you want with.
