** 3 Steps to World Domination!
******

1. Create some View which has the image and/or link to the 3rd party provider you
   wish to offer your users to authenticate against. Eg a google image, etc.
   PRO TIP: This pacakge installed some stock images under /images/Authentication

2. Wire up RedirectToAuthencation in some Method / Module / whatever framework
   you're using.

3. Handle the callback from the 3rd party by wiring up CheckCallback in another Method /
   Module / whatever again.

Done. That's it.

You'll have some generic user information which you can do the frak you want with.


Pro Tips
^^^^^^^^
1.   Free Images: Some free images have been added to /images/Authentication for you to
                  use on whatever View you cook up to offer your users authentication.
2.   Sample Code: We're so nice, we've included some sample MVC and Nancy code for you
                  to reference. Check out the /Authentication-Samples for what
                  you might fancy.
3. Coding Choons: You can't get away without some pro coding choons. Here's 2
                  which will make your nipples hard :
                  a) 
                  b)
